# Pixiv bookmark remover
This script is written as I maintain a large catalog of images originating from pixiv. For now it only reads a text file with post id's from images and opens them in a browser. 10 at a time that is.
For now you have to manually remove the like on a webpage as I only know enough to solver these simple problems with code.
This script has been tested on Linux but should work with all operating systems.
## How to use
In a text file you put post id's of the image you want to delete. One post id per line.
The highlighted part is the post id.

When ready start the script with
```
python main.py
```
